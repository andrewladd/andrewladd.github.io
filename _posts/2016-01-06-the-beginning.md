title: A New Year, 2016
---

Hello, and welcome to my wall of writing. Here I hope to accomplish a few things:

* Talk about what I'm working on, what interests me, or what's been on my mind. 
* Fill a gap in my writing-less life. I may type words every day, but not very formally.
* Record my experiences, so maybe someone else can learn from my perspective.

This year, 2016, I hope to produce two posts for each month. This number may increase or decrease, depending on how crazy the months get, but I hope to hit 24 posts by December 31st of this year. Wish me luck, and I'll see you in my first post.
