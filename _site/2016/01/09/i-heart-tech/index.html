  <p>I&#39;ve been on a computer for almost as long as I remember. Back then, I used it almost solely for playing video games (so many hours of Commander Keen) and doodling on MS Paint. As the years went by, it still surprises me that I was able to avoid the languages these programs I loved were written in. It took almost 19 years to finally see a line of code -- 2 years ago this month, studying Medical Sciences at Western University, in my first computer science course. Within the first few weeks, I realized it was something I was good at, and over the next few months, it caused me to reconsider my degree all together. </p>

<p>Now, I attend the University of Waterloo, studying Computer Engineering. I&#39;ve worked two jobs in the tech industry over the year and a half I&#39;ve attended. I&#39;ve written countless lines of code since my first, and hope to never stop. There&#39;s more to programming than just logic puzzles, which is how I initially grasped it; when you start to group together small functions, it becomes apparent that these systems can tell you much more than just fizz or buzz.  </p>

<p>The idea of AI, using a collection of varied, semi-unique inputs, finding a pattern, and applying them as a human might, is what deeply interests me. As we spend our time clicking away on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, a computer somewhere miles away tracks these movements, records them, and ties them to an internet version of ourselves. Over time, these recorded decisions add up. A computer can use this info and relate it to other info it gathers (ie. clicking on a link for baseballs and one for t-shirts may result in receiving an ad for baseball t-shirts!). As a result, feeds are tailored so they list what interests you most, without the need to explicitly tell it anything. </p>

<p>This is what I dream to work on: a system which anonymously monitors ones inputs, uses the patterns found, and responds based upon them. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li> a video game that responds to your skill level by progressively increasing or decreasing the difficulty, ensuring for the most balanced play-through possible.</li>
<li>a system which monitors the market, which can be used to buy and sell investments (ie stocks, real estate) using the patterns it has gathered.</li>
<li>an application that learns how to distinguish important phrases or words, which can be used for effectively indexing and sorting data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although slightly specific ideas, they can be stretched and built upon. One day, most of the systems we use will be able to utilize this pattern-finding to improve their accuracy. In other words, you will be able to ask your house for a coffee, and it won’t be all that weird when it puts in 0.834 teaspoons of sugar and 21mL of cream. </p>

<p>I may have gone off on a tangent, but if it isn’t already obvious, I <em>love</em> technology. Software is nearly limitless; every day, someone, somewhere, has created something that can automate a process that would take a human a considerable amount of time to complete. The compilation of these automations can both improve the lives of others and promote the expansion of humanity&#39;s knowledge. When these tools are combined with also ever-improving hardware, you&#39;re in for a hell of a ride. The sheer number of examples we have available would definitely assert that faster computers, vaster networks, and smarter AIs are the future -- one I&#39;m sprinting towards.</p>
